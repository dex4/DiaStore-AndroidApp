# DiaStore-Android

<p>DiaStore is my Bacherlor's Thesis mobile application.</p>
<p>It is designed to help people with diabetes, like me, to safely store<br>
their health data related to diabetes.</p>
<p>Besides the usual out of the box protection that local db storage has,<br>
DiaStore uses (To Be Implemented) fingerprint based encryption to<br>
protect the data stored in the local db.</p>
<p>Above all, it is a project in which I will integrade everything<br>
I know about Android development as I learn new things.</p>
